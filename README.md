## What The Program Does?
Shows the GUI for the calculator I had been working on all semester. The program\
won't have functionality such as clicking on a button and expecting the even to be\
handled. Functional buttons came later in the last project for the calculator, see [here](https://github.com/ihartzell/calculator-with-GUI).
